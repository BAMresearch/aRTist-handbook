Introduction to Tutorials
=========================

The tutorials are meant to lead you in small steps through the functionality of *aRT*\ ist. They give background information while building a complete example project with steps that you can follow.

Each tutorial explains a specific aspect of *aRT*\ ist. If you already feel confident about certain topics, you can skip them. At the beginning of each tutorial, the sample project that we have developed up to this point can be downloaded.

*Note* boxes show the actions that **you** should take during the tutorials.

.. note:: Start with a tutorial that interests you. If you are a beginner, it is recommended to start with ":ref:`The Virtual Scene`".
