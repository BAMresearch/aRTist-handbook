User interface
==============

When you open |artist|, you will see its main window (:numref:`guiMainWindow`) with the following areas.

* **Menu bar**, used to access detailed settings and commands.
* **Toolbar**, used to access the most commonly used functions and viewer settings.
* **Parameter panel**, used to control the current model parameters for the scene, X-ray source and detector.
* **Virtual scene**, a 3D scene view of the radiographic setup.
* **Docking area**, integrates additional program windows and modules. By default, the **Image Viewer** showing the simulated radiograph is placed here.
* **Status bar** displays what's currently going on.

:numref:`guiMainWindow` shows the default view of the user interface. The scene already contains two items: source and detector. The three main areas (parameter panel, virtual scene, docking area) can be scaled by clicking and dragging the edges of the respective areas.
