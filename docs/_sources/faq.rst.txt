How can I transfer my material list to another |artist| installation?
  The material list is maintained at |artist|'s profile directory (see menu :guilabel:`Help` → :guilabel:`About aRTist` → :guilabel:`About`) in the file ``materials.dat`` (text file of INI format). Copy the whole file or selected entries to transfer your material list to another profile directory.

  Individual material entries can also be transferred with help of a project file :code:`*.aRTist` which includes parts of these materials. A project file contains all material entries used in the project. By loading a project file all material entries will be added to the material list of the current |artist| installation.

I see a labeled frame, but no content. How can I get the content back?
  Double-click the frame to unfold it. 

  Labeled frames are used to structure the elements in the |artist| user interface. Many, but not all, of these frames are foldable. A double click on the frame or its label will fold the frame in or out accordingly.
