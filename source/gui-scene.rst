Scene - the virtual scene
=========================

The 3D visualization area shows the virtual scene view, a 3D representation of the setup (:numref:`guiSceneAdocSceneview`). 
The default view only contains source and detector. In the assembly, virtual parts (geometric objects) can be appended in the scene view, e.g. via the |16x16_icon-solid| Solid module.

    Virtual scene, scene view.
    
The virtual scene can be freely rotated, scaled and shifted in space in the following ways:

* Hold down the left mouse button over the empty space of the scene view and drag it. The scene will rotate.
* Hold down the right mouse button and drag. The scene view will scale.
* Hold down the middle mouse button and drag. The scene view will move with the mouse.
* A coordinate system pictogram is shown in the bottom left corner indicating the actual orientation of the scene view.

In this guide items define all parts, detector and source in the scene. While parts are only the geometric objects in the scene.

For selecting items in the scene view, use the :kbd:`Ctrl` key on the keyboard and click on them with the left mouse. 
The first selected item can be recognized by its yellow corners. All subsequent items will be marked with white corners. 

.. note::

    The order of selection can be important for :guilabel:`Geometry` applications.
