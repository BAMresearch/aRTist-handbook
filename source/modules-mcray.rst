McRay
-----
.. _McRaySection:

*McRay* is the Monte Carlo code integrated in |aRTist|. 
For the simulation of scattering effects, McRay is controlled by the :ref:`Scattering panel <ScatteringPanelSection>` alone. 
This module provides the detailed control of the *McRay* parameters. Their description goes beyond the scope of this guide.
