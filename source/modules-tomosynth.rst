TomoSynth
---------
.. _TomoSynthSection:

The **TomoSynth** module allows you to configure repeated projections at stepwise parameter variations. Geometrical transformations can be applied individually to any element of the scene. The module was developed to simulate arbitrary scanning trajectories.  

The :guilabel:`Laminography` tab offers settings for tube and detector position only. It provides a simple interface to facillitate laminographic scans. 
The :guilabel:`Advanced` tab offers settings for the actual selected part. Individual variations can be applied by sequentially selecting the respective parts.
