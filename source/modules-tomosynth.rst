=========

.. 3.6	TomoSynth (incl. menu description)

The TomoSynth module allows you to simulate tomosynthesis within |artist| (:numref:`tomosynth1a`). 
It consists of two pages: the Laminography page offers settings for tube and detector position and output options. 
The Advanced page offers settings that are mainly directed towards experts.

Setup variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tube (S) and detector (D) can be moved on the three axes X, Y and Z. Set the parameters in the following order:

**Variable Active** is used to select desired axis/axes via checkbox(es).

**Distribution** is used to choose a distribution out of the available options. A drop-down menu is activated when the corresponding variable is selected. 
Deterministic and random distributions are available. A deterministic distribution is a mathematical formula, which describes 
how to compute the value for a given image number step for a total of Nsteps images. Here, step varies from 0…Nsteps-1. 
A random distribution assigns a (pseudo-)random number with a given probability density to the associated variable. 
The pseudorandom numbers are generated by hashing sequence numbers with a fixed random seed and therefore are completely reproducible.

Please note that the sign of the radius (circle, arc, disc) defines the orientation of the rotation, where positive radius values indicate a right-handed rotation.
Deterministic distributions:

.. _here: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/expr.html#M22

* **linear** is used to linearly increase/decrease the parameter you selected.
* **logarithmic** is used to logarithmically increase/decrease the parameter you selected.
* **constant** sets a variable to a constant value. Most useful to define the axis of rotation for rotating objects.
* **circle_x** revolves in X-direction.
* **circle_y** revolves in Y-direction.
* **arc_x** is used to calculate arc in X-direction.
* **arc_y** is used to calculate arc in Y-direction.
* **disc_x** is used to disc in X-direction.
* **disc_y** is used to disc in Y-direction.
* **formula_rnd** is used to make a formula with a random variable.
* **formula** is used to enter an arbitrary mathematical formula to define a deterministic distribution. The expression is evaluated using the rules of expr of the Tcl scripting language. For a detailed reference, please consult the online documentation for Tcl here_. 


Random distribution:

* **uniform**
* **gaussian**
* **lognormal**



**Parameters** are used to fill in the values of activated parameters.

Preview |modules-Tomosynth-tomosynth_PreviewSlider| is used to see a preview in :ref:`ImageViewer <ImageViewerSection>` of the tube's and/or detector's movement for the current settings when moving the slider (if checkbox is activated). 
Beneath the settings for tube and detector, you can find a slide control next to the preview checkbox.

Output options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* choose a **Format** from the following options: *RAW*,* TIFF*, *TIFF 16bit* and *FLD 16bit*
* put in a **File name**
* put in the **Number of steps**
* choose **Output directory**

Alternatively, you may use the default settings.

When finished press the Run button to start the simulation or Reset if you wish to discard the changes you have made.

Advanced
--------

The settings in this tab are mainly directed towards experts (:numref:`tomosynth2a`).

Protocol
^^^^^^^^
It is possible to change the settings for each part of the scene.

**Variable Active** selects desired axis/axes via checkbox(es).

* Rotation Angle sets the rotation **angle**, the polar angle **theta** and the azimuthal angle **phi**.

* Position Shift sets the position shift in the three axes: **Δx**, **Δy** and **Δz**.

* Size Scale sets the size scale in the three axes: **Sx**, **Sy** and **Sz**.

**Distribution** is used to choose a distribution from the available options. A drop-down menu is activated when the corresponding variable is selected. 
Please note that the sign of the radius (circle, arc, disc) defines the orientation of the rotation, where positive radius values indicate a right handed rotation.

**Parameters** are used to fill in necessary parameters.

Tube parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Current drop-down menu is activated when **Current** is selected. Choose a distribution from the available options (**linear**, **logarithmic**, **constant**, **circle_x**, **circle_y**, **arc_x**, **arc_y**, **uniform**, **gaussian**, **lognormal**, **disc_x**, **disc_y**, **formula_rnd** or **formula**).

Voltage drop-down menu is activated when **Voltage** is selected. Choose a distribution from the available options (**linear**, **logarithmic**, **constant**, **circle_x**, **circle_y**, **arc_x**, **arc_y**, **uniform**, **gaussian**, **lognormal**, **disc_x**, **disc_y**, **formula_rnd** or **formula**).

**Preview** is used to see a preview in :ref:`ImageViewer <ImageViewerSection>`. Beneath the settings for tube and detector you can find a slide control next to the preview checkbox. 
Activate the checkbox and move the slider to see a preview of the tube's and/or detector's movement for the current settings.

Output options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* choose a **Format** from the following options: RAW, TIFF, TIFF 16bit and FLD 16 bit
* put in a **File name**
* put in the **Number of steps**
* choose **Output directory**
