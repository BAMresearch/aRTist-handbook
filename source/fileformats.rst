File Formats
============

|artist| supports several file formats for data input and output. The three most important ones are the *STL* format for loading part geometries, the *ARTSIT* format for saving and restoring the program status, and the *TIFF* format for outputting the simulation results.

All file formats supported by the :guilabel:`File` â†’ :guilabel:`Open...` dialog are also prepared for drag & drop. Accordingly, it is possible to drag a supported data file onto the |artist| program icon or window for opening.
