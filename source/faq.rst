How can I transfer my material list to another |artist| installation?
   The material list is maintained at |artist|'s profile directory (see menu :guilabel:`Help` → :guilabel:`About aRTist` → :guilabel:`About`) in the file ``materials.dat`` (text file of INI format). Copy the whole file or selected entries to transfer your material list to another profile directory.

I see a labeled frame, but no content. How can I get the content back?
  Double-click the frame to unfold it. 

  Labeled frames are used to structure the elements in the |artist| user interface. Many, but not all, of these frames are foldable. A double click on the frame or its label will fold the frame in or out accordingly.
