Manage Modules
==============

**Manage Modules** (:numref:`modulesManage`) lists all the installed modules and their version.
Unchecked modules are ignored at program start and are not available at runtime. 

Use the :guilabel:`Open aRTist package...` button for the dialog to install additional modules. The modules are provided as aRTist package files (.artp). Modules can be installed for all users (**system**) or only for the current user (**user**).
